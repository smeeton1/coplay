# Coplay

Coplay is an AI-generated project where all code and content are created using advanced artificial intelligence tools. The primary AI systems involved in generating this project are ChatGPT (for conceptual guidance, writing, and assistance) and Bito (for direct code generation).

## About the Project

The aim of Coplay is to explore the capabilities of AI in software development. Every component of the project, from architecture to implementation, is produced with the assistance of AI technologies.

## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT**: Utilized for brainstorming, drafting, and refining written content, as well as providing conceptual guidance and support in problem-solving.
- **Bito**: Focused on the direct generation of code, ensuring efficient and effective implementation of required features.

## Project Features

The code creates a window with a movable button. The button can be repositioned using the arrow keys, and clicking the button will close the window. This interaction provides a simple demonstration of GUI functionality.

There is also a Python version of this project, available as `coplay.py`, offering similar functionality.


## C++ Requirements and Compilation

For the C++ code, the `libsfml-dev` library needs to be installed. To compile the `coplay.cpp` file, use the following command:

```bash
g++ coplay.cpp -o coplay -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./coplay
```

## Contribution

Given the unique nature of this project, contributions are limited to maintaining the integrity of AI-generated content. Suggestions for improvements or additional AI tool integrations are welcome.

## Disclaimer

As all content is AI-generated, users should review and test the code thoroughly before using it in production environments.
